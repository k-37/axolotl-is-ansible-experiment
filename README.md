# Introduction

This repository is used to practice [Ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)). Commit messages will have detailed description which commands, documentation and other resources were used along the way. The goal is to have information on *why* and *how* in addition to *what* has changed. [`git blame`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-blame) and `git log` can be used to follow along, commit history can be seen as a tutorial. Commit Driven Learning (CDL). ðŸ¤¯
